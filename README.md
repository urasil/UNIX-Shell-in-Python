UNIX-Shell-in-Python is a [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) created for educational purposes. 
Similarly to other shells, it provides a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop), an interactive environment that allows users to execute commands. UNIX-Shell-in-Python has a simple language for specifying commands that resembles [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)). This language allows, for example, calling applications and connecting the output of one application to the input of another application through a [pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)). UNIX-Shell-in-Python also provides its own implementations of widely-used UNIX applications for file system and text manipulation: [echo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_(command)), [ls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ls), [cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)), etc.
